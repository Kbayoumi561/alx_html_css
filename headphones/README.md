# Headphone Company Landing Page

This project is a fully responsive landing page design for a headphone company. The design was created using **Figma**, and this implementation uses **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **FontAwesome** for the website structure and styling. The web page is fully responsive and switches to a mobile-friendly design when the screen width is 480px or less. 

## Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: The page adjusts to fit screen sizes ranging from desktop to mobile. A mobile version is activated at 480px or less screen width.
- **Hover/Active Effects**: Links and buttons respond to user interaction with hover and active states.
  - Links hover/active color: `#FF6565`
  - Button hover/active effect: `opacity: 0.9`
- **Center-aligned Content**: The content is constrained to a max width of 1000px and centered on the page for an optimized layout.

## Design and Fonts

The design follows a clean, modern aesthetic with clear sections highlighting the product, key features, and calls to action. 

### Fonts Used:

- **Source Sans Pro**: The main body font used throughout the page.
  - If not installed on your computer, you can download it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro).
  
- **Spin Cycle OT**: Used in specific sections to add character and emphasis. If the font is unavailable on your computer, you can find and install it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **FontAwesome**: For the inclusion of icons in social media links and other sections.
  
## Interactions

- **Hover States**: 
  - **Links**: When hovering or clicking on any links, they change color to `#FF6565` for a dynamic effect.
  - **Buttons**: Buttons on the page have an interactive hover and active state, where their opacity decreases slightly (`opacity: 0.9`), giving users visual feedback.

## Mobile Responsiveness

The web page switches to a mobile-friendly version when the screen width is **480px or less**. In the mobile version:
- The layout adjusts to better fit smaller screens.
- Elements stack vertically for easy navigation.
- The design prioritizes usability on mobile devices.

## Max-Width Content

- The content on the page has a maximum width of **1000px** to ensure it looks good on larger screens while staying centered in the viewport. Margins are applied to center the content within the page.
